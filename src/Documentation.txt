Order of file loading, starting with last loaded files and their dependencies
Framework:
- fileCopy.js
- readData.js
    - tabs.js
    - tab_manager.js
        - artifactHandler.js
            - transferToBaseStation.js
        - octomap_viewer.js
        - stopService.js

Hardcoded areas:
- darpa command post interaction variables
    - transferToBaseStation.js
        - (variable) this.ip_address_port
            - ip address and port to make connection to with http
        - (variable) this.authorization
            - authorization token in header of request
        - (variable) this.url
            - in the set url function paths are hardcoded according to desired request locations determined by darpa
            - currently a series of if else statements handle different formats darpa expects
- ros topics with desired namespaces related to functions of robot
    - tab_manager.js
        - (function) add_tab()
            - OdomTopic, ArtifactTopic, BatteryTopic, CmdPosTopic
    - octomap_viewer.js
        - (function) create_viewer()
            - variable cloudClient's topic for the point cloud data
- css styles for web page design
    - hardcoded associations between id and color for the page
    - any changes to id names need to be checked within the css files
    - only ids for tabs "Custom", "File", "Universal_Page", and "Artifact_Page"
- ros_gui launch script in ros_gui/scripts/
    - hardcoded location of ros_gui/src/ folder
    - location is needed for calling npm start

Launch Scripts:
- artifact_detection.launch
    - launches darknet_ros YOLO neural network and artifact manager for base station
    - used in situation where no robots are performing artifact recognition
    - in this case the base station should be receiving images from the robots and processing them
- artifact_ground_station.launch
    - launches both artifact detection and ground station
- ground_station.launch
    - launches multimaster and the components needed for the ros_gui
- multimaster_fkie.launch
    - launches multimaster in a state that only accepts the desired topics from other robots
- ros_gui.launch
    - launches gui with its dependencies rosbridge_server, rosapi, and tf2_web_republisher
    - needs rosbridge_server to connect the gui with the locally hosted ros nodes
    - needs rosapi to gather information about what topics are currently active
    - needs tf2_web_republisher to display 3D visuals in the gui

Description of each js file:
- fileCopy.js
    - used to send files over ssh to remote computer
    - functions are included within app.html <div id="File"> tab
    - attached in js file with jquery reference to id
- readData.js
    - file for handling major setup for ros gui. It creates and builds all designs and  code for every tab except for the static tab "File"
    - order of operations
        - establish ros connection (sets ros variable)
        - grabs topics from rostopic list
            - used to find what robots are connected
        - call CreateTab() to setup all robots and their corresponding subscribers for each tab in the gui
        - call setTopicMsg() to display values from default ros topic
        - set up window.pubTopicMsg() to handle publishing msgs in the future
        - call function to click on tab with id="defaultOpen", so that the Custom Tab loads initially
- tabs.js
    - file used to establish window.openPage() function for use with switching tabs and loading subscribers for robots
    - all robots immediately subscribe to their odometry and battery topics on tab load
    - the artifact topic is indefinitely subscribed no matter the tab
        - reasons: this topic is needed so the user can interact with incoming artifact names and adapt them accordingly
            - other topics are not always subscribed to because that increases the latency for input on the application
    - establishes graph with data and voltage outputs on individual robot tabs
    - recolors all tabs and their corresponding pages to match clicked tab
- tab_manager.js
    - establishes class for tabManager, the controller for this gui
    - functions included in class:
        - constructor()
            - initializes all major links to different tags within html file and grabs all robot names then create tabs for each one
            - each robot relies on odometry topic to determine if a robot is active
                if a topic does not exist then the robot does not exist
        - add_tab()
            - creates framework for new robot tab on gui
            - includes establishing chart relationships and function calls within tags
            - creates related ros topics for each vehicle and formats according to robot type
        - get_vehicleArtifactsList()
            - grab ArtifactsList variable from tab_manager for use on Artifact Tab or other uses
        - fix_tabs()
            - resizes all tabs so that they fit the screen nicely
        - get_Tab_OdomSub()
            - returns Tab_OdomSub with use on page switching to subscribe to the topic
        - applyCSS()
            - allows to use json formats for establishing styles on a tag in javascript
        - get_TopicsFromROS()
            - updates the TopicList information so that tabs can be removed or added correspondingly
    - (function) Chart.pluginService.register()
        - establishes chart color so that the graph is only colored within the bounds of the x-axis and y-axis
            - used to make chart more appealing
- transferToBaseStation.js
    - creates class for sending and receiving http messages to a server/ip address
    - functions included in class:
        - constructor()
            - establishes json message format including things such as the url, authorization token, and data
        - set url()
            - function called when the variable this.url is set
            - attaches different message formats according to the directory/topic data is being sent to
            - also establishes type of http request that is sent (POST or GET)
        - requestHTTP()
            - uses ajax to send http request to desired location declared in constructor
- octomap_viewer.js
    - contains function to create a viewer using ROS3Djs
    - functions in file:
        - create_viewer()
            - adds a viewer to a robot that streams point cloud data
- stopService.js
    - contains class to send estop message to robot
    - functions included in class:
        - constructor()
            - sets robot name
        - send_estop()
            - establishes estop topic connection and publishes message
