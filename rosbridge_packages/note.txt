These are the ros bridge packages that work with the gui.
Errors have occured when using ros bridge 0.11.4 with this gui.
Use this repo for the most up to date rosbridge software: https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite.git
rosbridge_suite 0.11.5 works and can be installed in the catkin src. make sure to build it before use.
These packages are a backup in case something goes wrong and we need to roll back.
